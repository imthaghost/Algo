Find Duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is 
between 1 an n prove that one duplicate number must exist

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Description: The algorithm thus maintains two pointers into the given sequence, 
one (slow) at xi, and the other (fast) at x2i. 
At each step of the algorithm, it increases i by one, 
moving slow one step forward and fast two steps 
forward in the sequence, and then compares the sequence values 
at these two pointers. The smallest value of i > 0 
for which slow and fast point to 
equal values is the desired value Î½
