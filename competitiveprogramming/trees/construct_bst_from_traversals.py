1) Pick an element from Preorder. Increment a Preorder Index Variable (preIndex in below code) to pick next element in next recursive call. 
2) Create a new tree node tNode with the data as picked element. 
3) Find the picked elementâ€™s index in Inorder. Let the index be inIndex. 
4) Call buildTree for elements before inIndex and make the built tree as left subtree of tNode. 
5) Call buildTree for elements after inIndex and make the built tree as right subtree of tNode. 
6) return tNode.
Thanks to Rohini and Tushar for suggesting the code.
